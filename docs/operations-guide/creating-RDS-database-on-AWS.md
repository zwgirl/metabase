# Configuring RDS for Metabase (the recommended guide)

If you want to move from using Metabase just for testing to something that is ready for the big time, you need to use a production-grade database like PostgreSQL or MySQL/MariaDB. This guide will provide you with all the steps for this venture. A high level architecture diagram of what you will achieve once you deploy Metabase with a dedicated application database can be [seen here](images/Metabase-AWS-SI.png)

## Step 1
In AWS, enter RDS in the search box or select the service from the dropdown button on the top left of the page. Once inside RDS, click on the `Create database` button

## Step 2
- Create Database: select MySQL or PostgreSQL as engine types, as these two are the ones that Metabase support as the Application Database (where Metabase will save all of its configurations). For this example we will choose PostgreSQL on its latest version available in AWS at this time (12.4-R1)

- Templates: you can leave `Production` selected or choose any other option that better suits your needs.

- Settings: type a unique `DB instance identifier` for your database. Also remember the username and a master password that you enter here as you will need those to configure the environment variables in Metabase.

- Instance size: you can choose any instance size that will fit your needs. As this is the application database for Metabase, the sizing of the RDS instance depends on the number of Metabase instances that will be connected to this database, number of users that are using Metabase at once and the number of questions, dashboards and configurations that are saved. To start, a `t3.small` is a good choice.
![RDS Instance size](images/RDSInstanceSize.png)

- Availability & Durability: on production deployments, you __should__ be using a Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) cluster, as this will ensure that the database does not goes down in case there is an issue on a single availability zone.
![RDS MultiAZ](images/RDSMultiAZ.png)

- Connectivity: 
  - ensure that you are deploying the database in the same VPC as the one you deployed the Metabase instance/s, otherwise they won't be able to see each other. 
  - create a __VPC security group__, as you will need to grant access from the Metabase instance/s to the database on the port that listens for connections.
![RDS VPC Security Groups](images/RDSVPCSecurityGroup.png)

- Additional configuration
  - enter `metabase` as the `Initial database name` as this will be the database that Metabase will use for all of its configurations. 
  - you can also configure the backup window in case you need to restore the backups at some point in time.
![RDS Initial Database](images/RDSInitialDatabase.png)

When you have completed all these configurations, click on the `Create database` button on the lower right part of the page and wait for the database to be created (this can take several minutes).

## Step 3
Once the database status is `Available`, you need to click on the DB identifier:
![RDS DB Identifier](images/RDSDBIdentifier.png)

On the page that appears after you click on the database identifer, you will see on the center of the page the **Connectivity & Security** section. This section will provide you with the **Endpoint** that Metabase needs to connect to the application database we just created.

![RDS Connection Data](images/RDSConnectionData.png)

In the **Security group rules** section, you'll see the Security Group that was created, but the group will have a rule that allows only one IP address to access the database. You need to change this rule to allow access to the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
![RDS Security Group Rules](images/RDSSecurityGroupRules.png)

To configure the rule for the database, select the INBOUND rule, then click on the Inbound rules tab on the lower part of the page.

![RDS Security Group Rules](images/RDSInboundRule.png)

When you click on Inbound Rules, you need to click on `Edit Inbound Rules` button that appears on the right side of the section

![RDS Edit Inbound Rule](images/RDSEditInboundRule.png)

On the edit page, you need to delete the IP address that appears as default, then add the security group that the Elastic Beanstalk has (the Security group name will have the keyword AWSEBSecurityGroup  in its name). Once you add this security group, click the `Save rules button`.

# Step 4 
After having finished all the previous steps, now you can go to the your Elastic Beanstalk deployment and add the RDS instance as the Application Database with [Environment variables](environment-variables.html) under the [Software configuration](running-metabase-on-elastic-beanstalk.html#set-or-change-environment-variables)

# Decouple your RDS database from the Elastic Beanstalk deployment

In the previous versions of this guide, we included the creation and link of a database by default. While this was an easier approach to simplify the deployments, there are many users who can't easily manage the RDS database as it is deeply coupled with the CloudFormation script that was created and executed once they created their Metabase instance.

**IMPORTANTE NOTES**: 
- this procedure will generate downtime so make sure to communicate your users that Metabase will be down till you recreate the environment with the new database.
- you will need the master username and password for the database you used when you created the Elastic Beanstalk instance

## Step 1
Identify the RDS endpoint that your Elastic Beanstalk is using by going to the configuration of the Environment and finding the endpoint value on the Database section.
![RDS endpooint](images/EBDatabaseEndpoint.png)
- If the Retention option is "Create snapshot" you are good to go and you can proceed to delete the whole Elastic Beanstalk environment as a snapshot (backup) of the database will be taken before being deleted
- In case the Retention option has other value, make sure to go to RDS, identify the database that is being used by the Elastic Beanstalk application, select it and take a snapshot
![RDS snapshot](images/RDSTakeSnapshot.png)

## Step 2
Go to the Elastic Beanstalk Metabase Application, select the running environment and terminate it (make sure that in the confirmation that pops up says that the database will be terminated __with snapshot__)
![Terminate environment](images/EBTerminateEnvironment.png)

This step can take many minutes and may even fail for reasons only known by AWS so you will have to identify through CloudFormation which resources failed to be deleted and delete them yourself.

## Step 3
Head to RDS but this time head to the `Snapshots` option on the left of the page where you should see a Manual Snapshot being listed
![RDS Snapshots](images/RDSSnapshotsMenu.png)

Select that snapshot and click on `Actions` -> Restore Snapshot

From this step on, you can follow the same steps as the [Configuring RDS for Metabase (the recommended guide)](#configuring-rds-for-metabase-the-recommended-guide) from [step 2](#step-2).
